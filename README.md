# Covider App

An android application that allows users to see information about risk of COVID in USC and instructors to monitor their class depending on studentsâ€™ health status in their class. USC COVID Dashboard provides information about the current status of pandemic on campus. However, manual contact tracing is labor-intensive and error prone. The app will allow Trojans to provide trustworthy information to keep the Trojan family informed and safe. 

# How to run the app

1. add MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyAn4-nM0lulBAR2S3bSVIa0z1vILQuG-uM in local.properties under Gridle.Script
2. Account for Test student: hyeriwoo@usc.edu
3. Account for Test Instructor: wang626@usc.edu 
4. password for all users is 123456


# Sprint 2 Updates:
Since our last sprint, we have implemented a required user story that we failed to do last time, and added two additional features. See below for details:
1. We implemented the notification system that notifies close contacts of people who tested positive or displayed symptoms to either recommend them to take a covid test or mandate them to take a covid test. 
2. We implemented a notification screen so that the notifications are saved and users can see their past notifications in the app. Users can also delete notifications so it stops displaying in the app. 
3. We added filters in the dashboard so users can filter the buildings so that they see all buildings, buildings that are where their classes are held, or buildings that are frequently visited by them.
